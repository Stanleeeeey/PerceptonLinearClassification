# PerceptonLinearClassification

## What Is it?
percepton algorithm is used for linear classification of points with two diffrent labels.

For example if we want to know if G point is red or blue

We can use Percepton algorithm to draw a line (decision boundary)

where all points over it are blue and under red
 according to this decision boundary G is red.
